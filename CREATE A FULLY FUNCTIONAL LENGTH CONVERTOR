//welcome to a New Challenge 
//In This Challenge you Will be Given a Task of Creating A fully Functional Length Converter
//HINT :-The Values To Be convrted are METER into CENTIMETER,INCH,FEET,KILOMETER

//The Code Is As Follows 

#include <stdio.h>                                      //Declaring Header Files

int main()                                              //Starting Of Main Program
{
  float cm,m,km,feet,inch;                              //Declaring of 5 float type variables
  printf("\n Enter Value in Meters :");                 //Printing Out some String 
  scanf("%f",&m);                                       //Taking Input From The User                  

  cm=100*m;                                             //Logic of the Program
  km=m/1000;                                            //Logic of the Program
  inch=cm/2.54;                                         //Logic of the Program
  feet=m/12;                                            //Logic of the Program

  printf("\n The Value In cm : %.2f",cm);               //Printing out The converted Value of centimeters
  printf("\n The Value In km : %.2f",km);               //Printing out The converted Value of Kilometers
  printf("\n The Value In inch : %.2f",inch);           //Printing out The converted Value of Inches
  printf("\n The Value In feet : %.2f",feet);           //Printing out The converted Value of Feet
}                                                       //END OF THE PROGRAM
